##
### Quick start
##

Copy all files from this directory (where you found this 'Readme' file) to your
desired location.

Finally, you can start putting the content of your thesis into 'thesis.tex'.


## Producing PDF, DVI and PS documents

# To build your thesis, run:

    make

This should build 'thesis.dvi', 'thesis.ps' and 'thesis.pdf' documents.

# To clean unwanted clutter (all LaTeX auto-generated files), run:

    make clean

# To clean absolutely all files produced by 'make', run:

    make distclean

For other build options, refer to the 'Makefile' file itself.



##
### But what if I don't want the template files in my thesis directory?
##

Put the files listed below into a directory where 'latex' can find them[1]:

    cam-thesis.cls
    CUni.eps
    CUni.pdf


[1] You can put these files either into the standard LaTeX directory for
classes[2], e.g., '/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/base', or a directory listed in
your 'TEXINPUTS' environment variable.

[2] Note: you'll have to rebuild the package index, usually with the command
'texhash'.

### University logo
##

The university updates its logo every now and then. You can find up-to-date
logos on this page (subject to change without notice):

Download and exchange the new logos with 'CUni.eps' and/or 'CUni.pdf'.
